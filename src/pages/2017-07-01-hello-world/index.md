I've wanted to start a blog for a while, but it never made it to the top of my queue. After coming back to school, finally got around to start one. Hopefully I can keep it going.
Looking forward to writing something more interesting in the future.

Inspired by Kyle's [post](https://www.bricolage.io/learning-open/), I hope to share some of my work here.
